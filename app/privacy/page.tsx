            <p>
              Re-Me follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files
              log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do
              this and a part of hosting services&apos; analytics. The
              information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP)
              addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and
              time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of
              clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally
              identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing
              trends, administering the site, tracking users&apos; movement on
              the website, and gathering demographic information.
            </p>

              cookies are used to store information including visitors&apos;
              preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor
              accessed or visited. The information is used to optimize the
              users&apos; experience by customizing our web page content based
              on visitors&apos; browser type and/or other information.
